# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Neural-Networks

The main objective of this analysis is to achieve a classification review of text with a positive or negative sentiment.

My research question for this analysis is â€œUtilizing sentiment analysis with neural networks for analyzing labeled review sentiments can the sentiments be identified as positive or negative?"

This analysis is accomplished with Tensorflow and Keras as well as nltk and sklearn.
